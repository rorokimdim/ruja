      <p class="abstract">
	We report the palladium-catalyzed amination of arenes to form N-aryl phthalimides with regioselectivity controlled predominantly by steric effects. Mono-, di-, and tri-substituted arenes lacking a directing group undergo amination reactions with moderate to high yields and high regioselectivities from sequential addition of iodosobenzene(diacetate) as oxidant. This sterically derived selectivity contrasts that for analogous arene acetoxylation.

      <p class="abstract">
        An alternative method to copper-catalyzed conjugate addition followed by enolate silylation for the synthesis of β-disubstituted silyl enol ether products (R<sup>1</sup>(R<sup>2</sup>)HCCH═C(OSiR<sup>4</sup><sub>3</sub>)R<sup>3</sup>) is presented. This method uses haloarenes instead of nucleophilic aryl reagents. Nickel ligated to either neocuproine or bipyridine couples an α,β-unsaturated ketone or aldehyde (R<sup>2</sup>HC═CHC(O)R<sup>3</sup>) with an organic halide (R<sup>1</sup>–X) in the presence of a trialkylchlorosilane reagent (Cl–SiR<sup>4</sup><sub>3</sub>). Reactions are assembled on the benchtop and tolerate a variety of functional groups (aldehyde, ketone, nitrile, sulfone, pentafluorosulfur, and <em>N</em>-aryltrifluoroacetamide), electron-rich iodoarenes, and electron-poor haloarenes. Mechanistic studies have confirmed the first example of a catalytic reductive conjugate addition of organic halides that proceeds via an allylnickel intermediate. Selectivity is attributed to (1) rapid, selective reaction of LNi<sup>0</sup> with chlorotriethylsilane and enone in the presence of other organic electrophiles, and (2) minimization of enone dimerization by ligand steric effects.

The two Pd-P bond lengths differ by about 0.04 Å and the biphosphane bite angle is slightly obtuse [92.92 (2)°]. There are three dichloromethane and one water molecule co-crystallized with the palladium molecule, all with atoms in general positions. Alternating water and palladium molecules form four-membered cyclic units through O-HCl and O-HO hydrogen bonding.

      <p class="abstract">A new method is presented for tandem reductive conjugate addition and silyl enol ether formation from cyclic and acyclic enones and enals in the presence of a Mn reductant, a Ni(terpyridine) catalyst, and a trialkylchlorosilane. The addition of secondary, tertiary, and hindered primary haloalkanes is demonstrated. Preliminary studies on the mechanism show that the intermediacy of L1(Ni)(<em>η</em><sup>3</sup>-1-triethylsilyloxyalkenyl)X or in-situ-formed RMnX is unlikely.</p>

      <p class="abstract">The direct reductive cross-coupling of alkyl halides with aryl halides is described. The transformation is efficient (equimolar amounts of the starting materials are used), generally high-yielding (all but one between 55 and 88% yield), highly functional-group-tolerant [OH, NHBoc, NHCbz, Bpin, C(O)Me, CO<sub>2</sub>Et, and CN are all tolerated], and easy to perform (uses only benchtop-stable reagents, tolerates small amounts of water and oxygen, changes color when complete, and uses filtration workup). The reaction appears to avoid the formation of intermediate organomanganese species, and a synergistic effect was found when a mixture of two ligands was employed.</p>

K. “<em>α</em>-Synuclein Budding Yeast Model: Toxicity Enhanced by Impaired Proteasome and Oxidative Stress” <em>J. Molec. Neurosci.</em> <strong>2007</strong>, <em>28</em>, 161-168. ISSN: 0895-8696</div>
      <p class="abstract">Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that results from the selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Misfolding and aggregation of the protein <em>α</em>-synuclein, oxidative damage, and proteasomal impairment are all hypotheses for the molecular cause of this selective neurotoxicity. Here, we describe a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model to evaluate the misfolding, aggregation, and toxicity-inducing ability of wild-type <em>α</em>-synuclein and three mutants (A30P, A53T, and A30P/A53T), and we compare regulation of these properties by dysfunctional proteasomes and by oxidative stress. We found prominent localization of wild-type and A53T <em>α</em>-synuclein near the plasma membrane, supporting known in vitro lipid-binding ability. In contrast, A30P was mostly cytoplasmic, whereas A30P/A53T displayed both types of fluorescence. Surprisingly, <em>α</em>-synuclein was not toxic to several yeast strains tested. When yeast mutants for the proteasomal barrel (doa3-1) were evaluated, delayed <em>α</em>-synuclein synthesis and membrane association were observed; yeast mutant for the proteasomal cap (sen3-1) exhibited increased accumulation and aggregation of <em>α</em>-synuclein. Both sen3-1and doa3-1 mutants exhibited synthetic lethality with <em>α</em>-synuclein. When yeasts were challenged with an oxidant (hydrogen peroxide), <em>α</em>-synuclein was extremely lethal to cells that lacked manganese superoxide dismutase Mn-SOD (sod2Δ) but not to cells that lacked copper, zinc superoxide dismutase Cu,Zn-SOD (sod1Δ). Despite the toxicity, sod2Δ cells never displayed intracellular aggregates of <em>α</em>-synuclein. We suggest that the toxic <em>α</em>-synuclein species in yeast are smaller than the visible aggregates, and toxicity might involve <em>α</em>-synuclein membrane association. Thus, yeasts have emerged effective organisms for characterizing factors and mechanisms that regulate <em>α</em>-synuclein toxicity.</p>

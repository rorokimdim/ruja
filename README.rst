Overview
--------

Code for ruja's personal website. Feel free fork/copy to use it for your own.

Setup
-----

To get an interactive development environment run:

.. parsed-literal:: lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

.. parsed-literal:: (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

.. parsed-literal:: lein clean

To create a release build run:

.. parsed-literal:: ./build-release

And open your browser in `release/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
